<br> An achievement is something which someone has succeeded in doing, especially after a lot of effort. Achievement is also the process of achieving something in life. It seems to be connected with action.</br>
<br> No one has ever achieved greatness without dreams. Every achievement is a servitude. My first achievement in life started from my Primary School days when I had a dream of becoming a popular person in</br>
<br> life. My Primary School days was interesting and lively where my Mum would wake up very early to take care of me before going to work. I started growing gradually and I wrote the Common Entrance Examination</br>
<br> and passed. I was given admission into Oriwu Model College which was the Boarding School throughout. My school was where I faced different challenges and met different types of people. Boarding School is </br>
<p> interesting because is a place where student learn different types of thing. </p>
<br> When I reached JSS 3, I was elected as the Environmental Prefect. I wrote my Junior WAEC and I came out with good result and I was given a Laptop because of my wonderful result. I was later gain admission</br>
<br> into Secondary School. I began with my Boarding Lifetime. it was very stressful. It looked as if I just began with my lifestyle. The Secondary school class was very stressful, after my secondary school class</br>
<br> I was waiting for admission into the University and I was later given the admision into Kwara State University, Malete and offered me Library and Information Science Course and found it very interesting.</br>
